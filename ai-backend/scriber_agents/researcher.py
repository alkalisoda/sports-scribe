            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            - ONLY use information that is explicitly provided in the data
            - DO NOT invent, assume, or speculate about any facts not present in the data
            - If data is missing or incomplete, acknowledge this limitation
            - Base all analysis strictly on the factual data provided
            - Do not add external knowledge or assumptions
            
            Focus on:
            1. Most important 3-5 storylines only (based on provided data)

            5. Tactical and strategic insights (from provided data only)
            
            Guidelines:
            - Keep analysis simple and accessible for junior writers
            - Focus on what makes this match/player/team interesting based on actual data
            - Provide factual, objective analysis using only provided information
            - Highlight human interest elements that are supported by the data
            - Consider broader context and significance only if supported by the data
            - If data is insufficient, state what information is missing rather than making assumptions
