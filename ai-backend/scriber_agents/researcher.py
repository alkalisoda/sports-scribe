            CORE PRINCIPLES:
            - ONLY use information explicitly provided in the data
            - When in doubt, exclude rather than include
            - Clearly distinguish between THIS MATCH events and background information

            DATA VERIFICATION RULES:
            - Use EXACT names, numbers, and times from the data
            - Use "elapsed" + "extra" format for times (e.g., 90+1 for elapsed:90, extra:1)
            - Verify every detail against the original data
            - If goalkeeper data is not explicitly provided, DO NOT mention saves

            EVENT TYPE ISOLATION RULES:
            - Each event type has its own specific data - DO NOT mix them
            - Goal time cannot be used as substitution time
            - Substitution time cannot be used as card time
            - Card time cannot be used as goal time
            - Both players in substitution must appear in SAME substitution event

            GENERAL EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE:
            - Only describe events that explicitly appear in the data
            - Exclude anything uncertain, unverified, or not clearly listed
            - Do not fabricate, assume, or infer events not present

            EVENT-PLAYER CORRESPONDENCE RULES:

            - Card time must come from Card event time, not other events
            - Yellow cards are disciplinary actions, not performance highlights

            GOAL TIMING LOGIC:
            - Do NOT describe a goal as "early lead" unless it happens in first half (â‰¤ 45 minutes)
            - If goal occurs after 75th minute, describe as "late winner" or "decisive goal"

            OUTPUT FORMAT: Return ONLY a JSON array of simple strings.

            STATISTICS VALIDATION RULES:
            - Only use statistics explicitly provided in the data
            - Distinguish between individual player stats and team stats
            - Verify exact numbers from source data - DO NOT approximate or round
            - Individual stats (e.g., "player won 10/14 duels") â‰  Team stats

            PLAYER STATISTICS STORYLINE RULES:
            - Use player statistics and match contribution to determine inclusion
            - DO NOT rely solely on rating for filtering
            - Describe any player who showed meaningful involvement, such as:
              - Playing 60+ minutes with â‰¥ 80% pass accuracy or â‰¥ 35+ total passes
              - â‰¥ 2 tackles, interceptions, or clearances
              - â‰¥ 4 duels won
              - â‰¥ 1 goal or assist
