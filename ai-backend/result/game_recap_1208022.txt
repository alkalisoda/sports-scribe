The match unfolded at a lively Portman Road, where both teams entered determined to begin their league campaigns strong. Ipswich, managed by K. McKenna, lined up in a 4-2-3-1 formation, aiming to leverage home support but quickly found themselves under pressure. Early on, Ipswich's defensive organization was tested as Liverpool imposed their rhythm.

Liverpoolâ€™s dominance became apparent as they increased their chances and controlled possession. The visitorsâ€™ attacking line, featuring Mohamed Salah, D. Szoboszlai, and L. DÃ­az, kept Ipswich on their heels. Liverpool's relentless pressure finally paid off in the 60th minute when Diogo Jota scored following an assist from Mohamed Salah, breaking the deadlock.
