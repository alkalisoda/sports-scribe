With new additions and tactical adjustments, the Red Devils sought to make a strong statement, while Fulham aimed to disrupt their hostsâ€™ ambitions in this competitive encounter.

Body:
The match unfolded at a tense pace, with both teams displaying attacking intent despite a cautious start. Early on, Manchester Unitedâ€™s Mason Mount received a yellow card at 18 minutes for a foul, a sign of the competitive edge in the game. Fulham responded with discipline, but their efforts were marred when Calvin Bassey earned a yellow card at 25 minutes, signaling the increasing tension on the pitch.

Manchester Unitedâ€™s attacking opportunities were steady, with five shots on goal and seven shots off target during the first half, compared to Fulhamâ€™s two shots on goal and four off target. Despite these efforts, the deadlock persisted through a rugged first half, featuring multiple foulsâ€”12 committed by United and 10 by Fulham. Both teams also registered several corner kicks, with Fulham earning eight to Unitedâ€™s seven, indicating the evenly contested nature of set-piece opportunities.

The game saw tactical shifts as the second half progressed. Manchester United introduced A. Garnacho and J. Zirkzee in the 61st minute, aiming to inject fresh energy into their attack. Fulham responded with substitutions of their own, bringing on R. JimÃ©nez and H. Wilson in the 78th minute to bolster their offensive options. The match became increasingly physical, with Andreas Pereira and Tom Cairney both receiving yellow cards at 70 and 73 minutes respectively, reflecting the high stakes and fervor on both sides.

Defensive resilience characterized much of the second half, with goalkeepers making crucial savesâ€”Manchester Unitedâ€™s A. Onana with two saves and Fulhamâ€™s B. Leno with four. The critical moment arrived in the 87th minute when J. Zirkzee, a substitute, scored the winning goal for Manchester United, assisted by A. Garnacho. The strike elicited celebrations from the home crowd and proved decisive in a match where both teams demonstrated tactical discipline and fighting spirit.

The closing moments saw Fulham pushing for an equalizer, with J. Stansfield entering the pitch in the 90th minute to add fresh legs, but Manchester Unitedâ€™s defense held firm. Substitutions in both squads reflected attempts to adapt to the gameâ€™s evolving dynamics, with Manchester United strengthening their backline and attacking options as the clock wound down.

Player performances shone through, particularly Zirkzeeâ€™s impact after coming on, and the disciplined, yet spirited, approach from both sides. The match statistics confirmed a tightly contested game, with Manchester United slightly edging Fulham in possession (55% vs. 45%), shots, and passing accuracy, showcasing their dominance in key attacking metrics.

Conclusion:
Manchester Unitedâ€™s 1-0 win over Fulham at Old Trafford signals a positive start to their Premier League campaign, with Zirkzeeâ€™s late goal sealing the victory. The game underscored the importance of tactical patience and defensive resilience, setting a hopeful tone for Unitedâ€™s season under E. ten Hag. For Fulham, the loss highlights areas to improve, particularly in finishing and discipline, as they look to build on their efforts. As both teams prepare for the season ahead, this opener provides a foundation for future matches filled with potential and renewed ambitions.
