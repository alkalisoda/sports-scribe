Manchester United 1-0 Fulham: Zirkzee's Late Winner Secures Opening-Day Victory at Old Trafford

**Introduction:**  
Manchester United opened their Premier League season with a narrow 1-0 victory over Fulham at Old Trafford, with a decisive late goal from J. Zirkzee proving the difference. The result marks a promising start for the Red Devils as they look to build momentum under manager Erik ten Hag, while Fulham's efforts fell just short in what was a competitive contest. The match not only sets an early tone for the season but also reflects the intense battle to start the season strongly in Englandâ€™s top flight.

**Body:**  
The match kicked off with both sides displaying tactical discipline, each lining up in a familiar 4-2-3-1 formation. Manchester United, eager to set the tone on their home pitch, dominated possession early on, holding 55% of the ball and attempting a total of 14 shots, five of which were on target. Fulham responded with a more conservative approach, registering 10 shots overall, though only two were on goal.

One of the key moments in the first half was a yellow card issued to Mason Mount for a foul at 18 minutes, quickly signaling the physical toll of the opening exchanges. Manchester Unitedâ€™s defensive solidity was highlighted by Harry Maguireâ€™s yellow card for simulation at 40 minutes, a decision that could have impacted team discipline but ultimately did not lead to any red cards. Additionally, AndrÃ© Onana was called into action with two saves during the match, maintaining Unitedâ€™s clean sheet going into halftime.

In contrast, Fulhamâ€™s goalkeeper Bernd Leno made four crucial saves, showcasing his shot-stopping skills and keeping the visitors in contention deep into the second half. Despite both teams striving for breakthroughs, it was clear that the match was heading for a tense conclusion.

That tension culminated in the 87th minute when A. Garnacho delivered a precise cross that found J. Zirkzee, who made no mistake with his finish to give Manchester United the lead. The late goal was met with rapturous applause from the home crowd and proved to be the winning moment. The scoreboard remained unchanged afterwards, with Fulham pushing for an equalizer but failing to break through Unitedâ€™s defensive line.

Substitutions also played an influential role, with J. Evans coming on at 81 minutes to shore up the defense in place of Harry Maguire. Fulham responded by introducing R. JimÃ©nez and Adama TraorÃ© at 78 minutes, attempting to turn the tide, but their efforts were thwarted in the dying moments of the match.

Player performances were notable across the pitch. Casemiroâ€™s commanding presence earned him a match rating of 8.5, often breaking up Fulhamâ€™s attacks and leading the United midfield. Mason Mount and Amad Diallo also stood out with solid contributions, while the defensive line, comprised of Lisandro MartÃ­nez, Diogo Dalot, and AndrÃ© Onana, maintained resilience throughout.

**Conclusion:**  
Manchester Unitedâ€™s 1-0 victory demonstrates their capacity to secure results in tightly contested matches and could set a confident tone for their season ahead. The late goal by J. Zirkzee not only secured the win but also showcased the attacking options available to Erik ten Hag. Fulham, while disappointed to fall short, displayed resilience and attacking intent that suggest they will be competitive throughout the season. As both teams look forward to their upcoming fixtures, this result reinforces Manchester Unitedâ€™s ambitions of a strong campaign, while Fulham aims to translate their solid form into more points in subsequent matches.
