From the outset, Brighton set the tone, controlling possessionâ€”62% compared to Evertonâ€™s 38%â€”and showcasing their attacking intent. Their early pressure paid dividends in the 25th minute when K. Mitoma, supported by Y. Minteh, capitalized on a rare look at goal, firing a precise shot past Evertonâ€™s goalkeeper J.

This goal was a result of Brightonâ€™s fluid attacking movement and sharp passing, with the visitors completing 86% of their passes, a clear sign of their dominance in possession.

Everton, meanwhile, struggled to find rhythm, managing only one shot on goal from a total of nine attempts, with four shots off target and six inside the box. Their only notable moment was a penalty attempt that was ultimately cancelled after a VAR review in the 48th minute, signaling their limited offensive threat throughout the match.

Brightonâ€™s lead extended in the 56th minute when D. Welbeck masterfully buried a shot, assisted by M. Wieffer, reflecting Brightonâ€™s ability to break down Evertonâ€™s defense with precision and patience. The visitors continued to press, creating multiple chances and maintaining their composure under pressure. Brightonâ€™s midfield control was evident, with players like J. Milner and M.
